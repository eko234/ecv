Easily build your resume with a yml file, you will need
groff, make, jq and yq to be able to run it, right now
it is a very simple make target that will read the db.yml
file, your cv.ms file and will produce a cv.pdf file, feel
free to use it, tell me about any issue or wathever.

special thanks to @Bugswriter
as I used a template he made.
